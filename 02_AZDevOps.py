# MAGIC ### Integrating with Azure DevOps and Azure Container Registry
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This section of the Solution Accelerator is be done outside Databricks. We are using Azure DevOps as the CI/CD tool to download, test and push a Docker image containing the ML model to an Azure Container Registry. Although we are leveraging this Azure services to build the automation, the pattern we are presenting here does not depend on any of those services, and other CI/CD solutions and/or image repositories such as Jenkins and Docker registry are fully supported as well. This automated deployment pipeline we are building will help us scale the deployment of ML Models to multiple Edge devices.

# MAGIC At a high level, the components used, and the path that is followed to get the Databricks-trained model pushed into Azure Container Registry as a self-contained Docker image are:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. MLflow webhooks will be used to automatically trigger an Azure DevOps pipeline
# MAGIC 2. Azure DevOps will download the artifacts for the model that we previously built from MLflow Registry and creates a Docker image containing the ML model
# MAGIC 3. Azure DevOps pushes the Docker image to Azure Container Registry
# MAGIC 4. Azure IoT Edgeâ€™s Deployment Manifest gets updated to instruct the Edge server to download and deploy the Docker image containing the ML model

# MAGIC ### Create and Configure Azure DevOps Pipeline
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The Azure DevOps Pipeline we are building will download the ML model artifacts from the MLflow registry and then create a Docker image that exposes the model to receive HTTP REST calls. Follow these steps to create an [Azure DevOps Pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline?view=azure-devops&tabs=java%2Ctfs-2018-2%2Cbrowser) and then copy/paste the YAML file that is included in the [Github repository](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/edge-ml-for-manufacturing/blob/main/azure-pipelines.yml) for this Solution Accelerator. The pipeline should look something like this:
